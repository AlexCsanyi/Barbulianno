                    Urban chic, much like shabby chic, tends to reclaim the old to make something new.  Reclaimed or re-invented materials with imperfect finishes, pointers to the past of a life lived.  Marks, divots, dents and scratches are seen as trophies of an illustrious past rather than imperfections.  But the materials themselves are tougher; steel, iron, boat wood, railway sleepers or floorboards.  Rather than faded whites and soft edges, its browns and blacks, rusted and rugged lines.

Whether itâ€™s loose cotton covers on a linen sofa, bleached-out wooden furniture or cute nautical bathroom accessories, this fun decor with a nautical twist is simple to put together and endlessly cheery.
